## 8) Dictionaries and Sets

### Dictionaries

A dictionary is similar to a list, but the order of the items does not matter and they are not selected by an offset. Instead, we specify a unique key to associate with each value. The key is often a string, but can be any of Python's immutable types. Dictionaries are mutable so we can add, delete and change key-value elements. To create a dictionary we use curly brackets around comma separated key:value pairs.

```python
# Code 1
# An example dictionary
dictionary = {'A': 1,
              'B': 2,
              'C': 3}
```
