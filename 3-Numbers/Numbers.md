## 3) Numbers

We shall begin by looking at Python's simplest built-in data types: Booleans, Integers and Floats. In Python the only values for the boolean data type are True and False. You can convert any Python data type to a boolean using the function `bool()`, where any non-zero number is considered True and zero-valued ones are considered False. Integers are whole numbers and bases (if you want to express numbers in ways other than the usual decimal base 10).
